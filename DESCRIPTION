Description: This package offers the possibility to access databases exposing JSON Files with Sensor Observation Service (SOS) convention defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) or by CKAN APIs. 
    We implemented the access to two different Databases as exposed by EURAC Research and the OpenData Portal South Tytol. 
    Both Databases offer rich environmental and meteorological Databases across the province of South Tyrol.
